# ✨ Overview

**Timer** is a lightweight, high-performance web-based timing application designed with simplicity and precision in mind.

Built entirely using **Vanilla JavaScript**, this project demonstrates strong understanding of:

- Time-based logic handling  
- State management  
- DOM control  
- Performance-safe interval management  
- Clean and scalable front-end architecture  

The goal was not just to create a timer — but to build a well-structured, production-ready micro application.
